# Tensorflow AI Pipeline

This repository is under development. A classic Machine Learning (Deep Learning) pipeline is shown in Tensorflow for classification of audio signals. At the moment, a notebook was incorporated from where the entire process was triggered. In the future it is sought to factor this code.
